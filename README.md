# CommonTasks

## About
CommonTasks is an attempt to create some everyday utility commands for the new
Firefox Graphical Command Line Interface (GCLI).

The inspiration behind this project is Vimperator, the add-on that creates a
Vim editor like environment inside Firefox. I don't use all the commands of
Vimperator but some of them were quite handy.

## Setup
It is extremely easy to start using these commands with your Firefox 16 stable
or latest Nightly builds.

Follow these simple steps to start using these commands:

1. Clone this repository using the `git clone` command.  
2. Start Firefox.  
3. In a new tab, open `about:config`.  
4. Set the value of `devtools.commands.dir` preference to the path of the repository on your machine.  
5. Restart Firefox.  

That's it! You are good to go.
